          We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable
          license to access and use the Service for your personal and

          The Service and its content, features, and functionality are owned by
          us and our licensors and are protected by international copyright,
          trademark, patent, trade secret, and other intellectual property or

        </p>
        <h1>Disclaimer of Warranties</h1>
        <p>
          The Service is provided "as is" and "as available", without any
          warranties of any kind, either express or implied. To the fullest
          extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, including but not
          limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
          purpose, title, and non-infringement. We do not warrant that the
          Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, secure, accurate, reliable,
          or available at any time or location. We do not warrant that any
          defects or errors will be corrected. We do not warrant that the
          Service is free of viruses or other harmful components.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Service relies on data from TikTok's API and other third-party
          sources. We do not warrant the quality, accuracy, completeness,
          timeliness, validity, legality, or availability of such data. We are
          not responsible for any errors or omissions in such data, or for any
          loss or damage that may result from your reliance on such data. You
          are solely responsible for verifying the data before using it for any
          purpose.
        </p>
        <h1>Limitation of Liability</h1>
        <p>
          To the fullest extent permitted by law, we and our affiliates,
          directors, officers, employees, agents, licensors, and partners will
          not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special,
          consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages arising out of or in
          connection with your access or use of (or inability to access or use)
          the Service, including but not limited to damages for loss of profits,
          data, goodwill, or other intangible losses, even if we have been
          advised of the possibility of such damages. In no event will our total
          liability to you for all claims arising out of or relating to the
          Service exceed one hundred US dollars (US$100).
        </p>
        <p>
          Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain
          warranties or liabilities, so some of the above exclusions and
          limitations may not apply to you. In such cases, our liability will be
          limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.
        </p>
        <h1>Indemnification</h1>
        <p>
          You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless us and our
          affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, licensors, and
          partners from and against any and all claims, demands, actions,
          liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorney's
          fees) arising out of or relating to your access or use of (or
          inability to access or use) the Service, your violation of these
          Terms, or your infringement of any third party rights. We reserve the
          right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter
          subject to indemnification by you, in which case you agree to
          cooperate with us in defending such claims. You agree not to settle
          any such claims without our prior written consent.
        </p>
        <h1>Termination</h1>
        <p>
          We reserve the right to terminate your access to and use of the
          Service at any time and for any reason, with or without notice. We may
          also suspend your access to the Service if we suspect that you have
          violated these Terms or any applicable law or regulation. Upon
          termination of your access to the Service, your license under these
          Terms will also terminate. Any provisions of these Terms that by their
          nature should survive termination will survive termination, including
          but not limited to disclaimers of warranties, limitations of
          liability, indemnification obligations, and dispute resolution
          provisions.
        </p>
        <h1>Changes to These Terms</h1>
        <p>
          We may revise these Terms from time to time at our sole discretion. We
          will notify you of any changes by posting them on this page and
          updating the "Last Updated" date at the top. You are expected to check
          this page periodically for any changes. Your continued access or use
          of the Service after any changes become effective constitutes your
          acceptance of the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the revised
          Terms, you must stop accessing or using the Service.
        </p>

        <h1>Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h1>

        <p>
          These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
          of Delaware without regard to its conflict of law principles.
        </p>

        <p>
          Any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or your access
          or use of (or inability to access or use) the Service will be resolved
          by binding arbitration administered by JAMS under its Streamlined
          Arbitration Rules and Procedures then in effect. The arbitration will
          be conducted by a single arbitrator in Wilmington Delaware applying
          Delaware law. The arbitrator's award will be final and binding and may
          be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
        </p>

        <p>
          You agree that any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an
          individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not
          permitted. You waive your right to participate in a class action
          lawsuit or class-wide arbitration.
        </p>

        <p>
          If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration
          we each waive any right to a jury trial.
        </p>
