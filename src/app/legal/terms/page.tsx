        <p>
          Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or in connection
          with these Terms or the Services shall be resolved by binding
          arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration
          Association. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator
          mutually agreed upon by the parties or appointed by the American
          Arbitration Association. The arbitration shall take place in
          Frankfurt, Germany, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. The
          arbitration shall be conducted in English. The arbitrator's award
          shall be final and binding and may be enforced in any court of
          competent jurisdiction. You agree to waive any right to a jury trial
          or to participate in a class action or representative action with
          respect to any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or in
          connection with these Terms or the Services. Some jurisdictions do not
          allow the exclusion or limitation of certain rights, so some or all of
          the above exclusions or limitations may not apply to you.
        </p>
        <h1>9. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h1>
        <p>
          These Terms and the Services shall be governed by and construed in
          accordance with the laws of Germany, without regard to its conflict of
          law principles. Any legal action or proceeding arising out of or in
          connection with these Terms or the Services shall be brought
          exclusively in the courts of Frankfurt, Germany, and you consent to
          the personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts.
        </p>
        <h1>10. Miscellaneous</h1>
        <p>
          These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us
          regarding the Services and supersede any prior or contemporaneous
          agreements, communications, or understandings. Our failure to exercise
          or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as
          a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms
          is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, such provision
          shall be modified or replaced by a valid, legal, and enforceable
          provision that best matches the intent of the original provision. The
          remaining provisions of these Terms shall remain in full force and
          effect. You may not assign or transfer your rights or obligations
          under these Terms without our prior written consent. We may assign or
          transfer our rights or obligations under these Terms at any time
          without notice or consent. These Terms do not create any partnership,
          joint venture, employment, or agency relationship between you and us.
          Nothing in these Terms shall be construed as creating any rights or
          benefits for any third parties.
